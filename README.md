# **Predictive Modeling of Housing Prices in the Balearic Islands**

**Project Description**

This project aims to analyze and predict housing prices in the Balearic Islands using data science and machine learning techniques.

**Objectives**


*   **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Gather and preprocess housing data from the Balearic Islands.
*   **Handle missing values and inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify patterns and trends in the dataset and
Visualize key variables such as price, location, and property type.

* **Predictive Modeling**: Develop, optimize and evaluate models to predict housing prices.


*  **Deployment**: Deploy the best model as a web application or API.





**Motivations**

The Balearic Islands' real estate market is dynamic and complex. Accurate price predictions can help homebuyers, investors, real estate agents, and policymakers make informed decisions.

**Expected Outcomes**

Reliable predictive models for housing prices.
Insights into market trends and property values.
A practical tool for real estate price estimation. By the end of this project, we aim to deliver a predictive model and valuable insights into the Balearic Islands' housing market.
